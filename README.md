# Prototype-w-GenAI
 
Briefly describe what the code is supposed to do.
- The code is supposed to take a YMCA link that contains event programming details and scrape some information from it.
Does the code work? If not, what's broken.
- The actual scraping part is broken and doesn't work.
How is the code better than what the team currently has?
- I don't think the code is better than what the team has. I thought the UI would be nicer, but our very simple UI is still better.
How is the code worse?
- The primary functionality of the code does not work.
How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?
- I tried 4 times before I got a response that worked. The previous code componenets were incomplete, didn't work, or did not have a front end aspect and required manually putting the link somewhere in the code.
Overall impression of the experience
- GPT is a great tool, however we can't rely on it entirely. Some aspects of it are great (it seems to be decent at CSS) and parts of the code can definitely be used, but we can't expect it to create the whole project.
